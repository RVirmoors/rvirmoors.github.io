*This is what I'm currently working on. Idea taken from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/).*

This year I was tapped to start teaching Game Development and Prototyping at our sister M.A. programme, Art of Game Design. In order to keep the impostor syndrome at bay (and against some well-meaning advice), I've challenged myself to make a game. I'll write a post when I have something tangible... for now, the nutshell is it's a 2D top-down interactive story, driven by a semi-generative narrative.

I'm still figuring out the mechanics, while going through all sorts of resources. I especially love digging through narrative design theory in places like [Emily Short's blog](https://emshort.blog/2019/01/08/mailbag-self-training-in-narrative-design/). Between this and trying out every game engine out there, the project should be done by 2050.
