*This is what I'm currently working on. Idea taken from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/).*

Once again, the semester put pretty much all my projects on hold. I'll make a quick list of what I want to get done this Summer, to be crossed off and blogged about in due time:

- bitsy game
- pd max shortcuts
- rolypoly~ work (Max object, velocity, other models?)
- violin concerto live electronics
- generative narrative game (at least some rudimentary prototype)
- hopefully some music

Let's hope looking back on this 3 months from now won't be *too* embarrassing.
