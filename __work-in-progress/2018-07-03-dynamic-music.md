title: Dynamic music?
---

It's one of those things that are both obvious and elusive: of course music is inherently interactive and
perceptually different every time. It's so self-evident to us that we often overlook it. Meanwhile,
any dynamics in computers have to be explicitly programmed, which means that representation of dynamics in
computer music is vital.

In my [PhD thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01412402)
I tried to use dynamicness as a theme to tie together different contributions to computer music. Did I
do it justice? Nope, which is why I keep coming back to it.

(to be continued.)
