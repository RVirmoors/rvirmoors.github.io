The newest episode is on Jacques Rancière's book THE IGNORANT SCHOOLMASTER (1987), based on the story of an early-19th century French teacher who gets students in Belgium to learn French, without either party being able to speak the other's language!","\n","^A big takeaway is that intelligence and the ability to learn are equal in everyone, and not conditional on the teacher's knowledge. Indeed, we can learn to navigate the tools we need on our own (like I'm doing with INK right now!), and my best teachers have been the ones that provided a clear direction and/or a space to work things out.

Well, for one, it paints a contrast between the top-down (\"old Master\") type of \"teaching\" or \"immersing\" a player through our mechanics or story, versus enabling a conversation in which players are active participants, with gameplay emerging therefrom.
