title: I (almost) found my MMus dissertation
---

Digging through old harddrives I came upon an late draft of my dissertation project documentation,
written in mid-2010 at the University of Leeds. TLDR: [here](../public/documentation.pdf) it is.

Now, my year in Leeds in '09-'10 was thoroughly life changing. Particularly the last
few months that I spent completing my final project, are probably my most focussed and productive,
before or since. And the theme of adaptive music interaction, has been close to me ever since.

And at the end I was left with the odd feeling that many get post-graduation, of total depletion yet
wishing I could've stayed longer. My academic ambitions fulfilled, I decided to go back home and,
I guess, apply my new superpowers in the real world. Or something.

Which is why I didn't even try to present my work at a conference. Now, it may not be the most
groundbreaking music tech ever, but back in 2010 adaptive improv systems using neural networks
and concatenative synthesis didn't grow on trees like they do today. After submitting my final work,
text and software, I promptly lost it forever. I don't remember if I deleted it on purpose or it got
misplaced, fact is it's all gone and the school also removed it from their records.
