title: I (almost) found my MMus dissertation
---

Digging through old harddrives I came upon an late draft of my dissertation project documentation,
written in mid-2010 at the University of Leeds. TLDR: [here](../public/documentation.pdf) it is.

Now, my year in Leeds in '09-'10 was thoroughly life changing. Particularly the last
few months that I spent completing my final project, are probably my most focussed and productive,
before or since. And the theme of adaptive music interaction, has been close to me ever since.
