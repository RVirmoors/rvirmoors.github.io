title: learning Ink
---

Started learning how to use Inkle's [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), a great tool for writing branching narratives. The first thing I wrote with it was about... learning Ink (how original!), and a couple other things I wanted to tell my students but [gave them this instead](../ink/learning-ink/index.html).

As I mention there, I really like the prospect of having dynamic text in tutorials / lecture notes. That would mean integrating the Ink parser with whatever markdown/jekyll/foam/vscode system I'm using now, which seems like a bit of work. Maybe I'll get around to it someday.

*(edit 12 Nov) I did an intro workshop for Ink, slides are [here](https://bit.ly/intro-ink).*
