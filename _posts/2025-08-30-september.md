The month of September is usually when things get moving, but this year a whole bunch of exciting events with great people have lined up. In the hope that I won't jinx them by listing them here, I wrote this post to convince myself that they're actually happening!

First of all, as with every year, we are accepting candidates for our wonderful [interactive technologies MA program](https://itpma.notion.site). It's always a gamble how many people will apply, and I always get nervous around this time although we've always had awesome applicants. If you think it's for you, don't hesitate and go for it! You have until 9 September to [apply online](https://admitere.unatc.ro/tehnologii-interactive-pentru-arte-performative-si-media/).

I'm now getting ready to fly to Linz with our ITPMA students for Ars Electronica, where we will once again be part of [the Campus exhibition](https://ars.electronica.art/panic/en/view/equilibria-20e38ddb450c81c9a300d1b8d17c46f2/).

Then a few days later I'll be in Madrid with Simona Deaconescu performing our Collective Cadence show at the [FIVER'25 festival in Madrid](https://www.centrodanzamatadero.es/actividades/fiver25).

If that wasn't enough, when I come back I'll have a couple of days to prepare for the [new piece by Constantin Basica](https://www.festivalenescu.ro/ro/festivalul-george-enescu/concerte/ultima-piesa-concert-imersiv-sincretic-1779979835), where I'm developing a reactive music system for the opening section. As always with Constantin, expect the unexpected! It's gonna be great, I just hope my contribution will be up to snuff.

Finally, the one thing in September I'm most looking forward to has nothing to do with me. It's [the release of the long-awaited final (?) album](https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/cardiacs-tim-died-album-impossible-finish-3838088) from my favourite band, [Cardiacs](https://www.cardiacs.net/). If you haven't heard them, my obsession started with these [two](https://youtu.be/OxhuQWKwbqY) [videos](https://youtu.be/N5QYijFfOaQ).[^1] I've been hopeful but quite nervous about what this new album would turn out like, but much of my apprehension was put to rest when it was revealed that [Mike Vennart](https://vennart.bandcamp.com/) (ex Oceansize) sings on it. It looks like they'll be touring with him on vocals, which judging by his performance [singing Dirty Boy](https://youtu.be/sYT1oo4tICE), should be an unmissable event!

[^1]: I got into Cardiacs in early 2008, a few months before leader Tim Smith fell ill, putting all band activities on indefinite halt. Including, obviously, the November '08 London show which I'd already got my ticket for... I can't express how much Tim's music has meant for me, and it's so wonderful that many others have been keeping it alive.
