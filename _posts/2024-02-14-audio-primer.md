title: an intro to audio for music
---

I've been wondering how long would it take me to explain the basics of audio for people wanting to get started making music or designing sound with computers. The not so impressive answer: just under two hours, apparently.

Now, is a video like this the optimal way to learn about these things? Frankly, I doubt it... for all the video content we consume, I'm still skeptical to their efficiency. I first learned a lot of this by reading [the user manual](http://www.midimanuals.com/manuals/steinberger/cubase_sx_2/operation_manual_english/operation_manual_en_10735k.pdf) and getting to grips with my recording software (Cubase SX2 back in the day), alongside playing guitar and writing songs for the first time.

Everyone's path is different. This video is nothing that special, but if you're in the target audience then it can't hurt. Worst case you wasted some time on youtube, which we all do all the time anyway.
