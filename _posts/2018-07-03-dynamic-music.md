title: Dynamic music?
---

It's one of those things that are both obvious and elusive: of course music is inherently interactive and
perceptually different each time it appears. It's so self-evident to us that we often overlook it. Meanwhile,
any dynamics in computers have to be explicitly programmed, which means that representation of dynamics in
computer music is vital.

In my [PhD thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01412402)
I tried to use dynamicness as a theme to tie together different contributions to computer music. Did I
do it justice? Hell no. Is it something still worth bothering about? I think so.

(to be continued.)
