title: Ditch Academia.edu!
---

You know that scholarly friend you have who's way into for-profit companies circulating her work? Wait, there's no such person?
So why are sites like Academia.edu and ResearchGate still a thing?

Granted, I'm way late on the delete-academia train. There have been brilliant posts like
[this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/01/23/dear-scholars-delete-your-account-at-academia-edu/),
[this](http://numismatics.org/pocketchange/open-access-academia-edu-and-why-im-all-in-on-zenodo-org/), and
[this](https://icietla.hypotheses.org/114) floating around for years now and, at least in my field, I rarely see people use
these commercial gatekeeper repos.

So the time finally came to get off my ass, delete my papers from Academia, and move them to an open archive. At this rate, in 10 years
maybe I'll apply for an arXiv.org account!

Now, where should you upload your work? [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/) (CNRS France) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERN Swiss)
are great options, and as it happens, some of my papers were already on both sites. I went with HAL simply due to the
snappier integration with [ORCID](https://orcid.org), the international research infrastructure everyone should probably be a part of.

There we go, my papers are now on [HAL](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/grigore-burloiu), and at my
[ORCID profile page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9059-9621). I feel like a real grown-up.

Oh, and just to bury the lede. This summer I did manage to build a working prototype and publish my work, most notably at the brilliant
CSMC+MuMe [Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/programme.html). I'd been meaning to blog
about the project on here, but it was a very busy summer, followed by an even crazier semester. So it goes. The paper is
[here](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/papers/CSMC__MuMe_2020_paper_30.pdf), and I also submitted
a summary as an [ISMIR LBD](https://program.ismir2020.net/lbd_422.html). You can get an idea of the work from my slideshow presentation:

I care a lot about this project and I do mean to keep developing and documenting it. But right now my focus is on completing the semester and staying sane.
