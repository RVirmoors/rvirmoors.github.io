title: Ditch Academia.edu!
---

You know that scholarly friend you have who's way into for-profit companies circulating her work? Wait, there's no such person?
So why are sites like Academia.edu and ResearchGate still a thing?

Granted, I'm way late on the delete-academia train. There have been brilliant posts like
[this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/01/23/dear-scholars-delete-your-account-at-academia-edu/),
[this](http://numismatics.org/pocketchange/open-access-academia-edu-and-why-im-all-in-on-zenodo-org/),
[this](https://icietla.hypotheses.org/114) floating around for years now and, at least in my field, I rarely see people use
these commercial gatekeeper repos.

So the time finally came to get off my ass, delete my papers from Academia, and move them to an open archive. At this rate, in 10 years
maybe I'll apply for an arXiv.org account!

Now, where should you upload your work? [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/) (CNRS France) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERN Swiss)
are great options, and as it happens, some of my papers were already on both sites. I went with HAL simply due to the
snappier integration with [ORCID](https://orcid.org), the international research infrastructure everyone should probably be a part of.

There we go, my papers are now on [HAL](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/grigore-burloiu), and at my
[ORCID profile page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9059-9621).
